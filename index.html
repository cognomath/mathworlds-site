		<h3>Our Story</h3>
		<p>
			Nina Dubinsky has been teaching math to kids of all ages and also has experience in curriculum design and educational
			research.
			<br> <br>
			Anna Shapiro-Mackler's experience ranges from software development to owning and running a printing shop,
			<br>
			from being an account manager for an offshore company to homeschooling a special needs child. She is an expert in
			problem-solving, whether the problems are in business or in math.
			<br><br>
			As high school students we both experienced the joy of learning math by problem-solving and exploration.
			<br>
			That's why we understood each other immediately when we discussed our vision for ideal online educational children's games.
			<br><br>
			We imagine children playing online games of their choice, enjoying the process,
			<br>
			and learning mathematics naturally when and where it is needed, just like they would learn a language.
			<br><br>
			Our dream is to let children experience the joy of playing and the excitement of learning mathematics - at the same time.
			<br><br>
			Math Worlds has been created to put this dream into practice.
