<h2>Mission Statement</h2>

<p>Math Worlds’ mission is to support elementary school children in developing perseverance and
problem solving skills while learning mathematics.
To achieve this, Math Worlds is developing a structured collection of online games and
activities that will require minimal adults’ support and contain almost no explanations,
thus letting children develop their math knowledge on their own in a highly individualized way.</p>
